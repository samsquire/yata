YATA based algorithm for CRDT edit merging in python

This is really simple implementation of [Near Real-Time Peer-to-Peer Shared Editing on Extensible Data Types](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310212186_Near_Real-Time_Peer-to-Peer_Shared_Editing_on_Extensible_Data_Types) and inspired through the work of Yjs and the YATA algorithm.
